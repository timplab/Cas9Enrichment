Hi there
to do the actual methylation calling with nanopolish,
  the shell script provided (run_nanopolish_methcall.sh) runs through methylation calling as outlined on the nanopolish documentation: 
 peep this guy : https://nanopolish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quickstart_call_methylation.html


The methcalls made by nanopolish are used as input to the 'make_red.blue_bams.sh',
   which makes new bam files for easy visualization on the CG-bisulfite mode of IGV.
