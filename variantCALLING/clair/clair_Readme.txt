We ran clair to call variants for GM12878 data
at the time of our submission, we were still operating on Clair v1 (https://github.com/aquaskyline/Clair)
We used the 'callVarBam' submodule for variant calling using the 'ont/r94-flipflop' model which is available for download at the Clair v1 github 

Clair has since been released via a pre-print and updated git repo with detailed documentation for use :
